# Algorithmic Games

This repo contains research notes and explorative code into different algorithmic economics and game theory instances.

Algorithmic Games is at the of Computational Complexity ,Game Theory and Economics the subjects of which are mechanism design,
equilibria, routing problems...

My interests grew mostly from the applications of these into building decentralized financial systems.
